      <li>Winners will take ten items of any type (excluding netherite items) from the losing party</li>
      <li>Surrender terms can be leveraged by the attacking party, however if the defending party declines the terms, the attacking party can ask terms again (same terms or not) until sated or war continures</li>
      <li>A date and time will be set for war so that it isn't unfair. Both parties must agree on a time (time can be rescheduled if irl events get in the way)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that this website is still a work-in-progress as I am still learning html. I will continue to update the site as my knowledge increases. Note that I will be updating the members weekly so if you don't see your username dm me and I'll make sure to add you in the next push.</p>
